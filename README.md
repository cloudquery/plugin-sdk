# CloudQuery Plugin SDK

CloudQuery SDK enables building CloudQuery source and destination plugins.

Source plugins allows developers to extract information from third party APIs and enjoying built-in transformations, concurrency, logging, testing and database agnostic support via destination plugins.

Destinations plugins allows writing the data from any of the source plugins to an additional database, message queue, storage or any other destination without recompiling any of the source plugins.
